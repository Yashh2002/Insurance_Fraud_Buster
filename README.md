🛡️ Insurance Fraud Detection System

A Machine Learning powered web application that detects fraudulent insurance claims using Logistic Regression.
The system enables users to submit claim details via a Django web interface and instantly receive fraud risk predictions along with visual insights.

This project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of ML + Web Development + Database integration, making it highly relevant for Python Developer / Data Analyst / ML roles.

🚀 Project Highlights
Developed an ML-based fraud detection model using Logistic Regression.
Built a Django web application for real-time insurance claim submission.
Integrated MySQL database to store claim records and prediction results.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify fraud patterns.
Evaluated model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Created data visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn for better interpretability.
Achieved approximately 75% model accuracy.
🧠 Problem Statement

Insurance fraud leads to billions of dollars in losses every year.
Manual claim verification is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project aims to:

Automate fraud detection
Improve decision-making using ML predictions
Provide interpretable insights through visualizations
Reduce fraudulent claims and financial losses
